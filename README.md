# Photography Portfolio Frontend

This is a frontend to my Photography Portfolio repository. I was inspired to make this because a friend recommended the stack I'm using.

That stack is this:

- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind

After completing this project, I admit that the process was FAR less painful than the native frontend in the Photography Portfolio website. 

I have also incorporated some extremely useful tools to complete this. \<Masonry /> was particularly useful as I had tried to create my own masonry layout twice. The various edge cases and unforseen technical difficulties I encountered rendered my attempts messy and unprofessional. While the library is not without errors, I must admit that it does everything I wanted and more, and does it all with ease.
